        <p class="lead mb-4">Jazmin Gonzalez is a humanitarian whose main focus has been to help as many individuals as possible create a better life for themselves by helping them reach their full potential. Her career and experience range from volunteer work to more prestigious job titles, but nevertheless, her goal has always been to create a better society through the betterment of the individuals.<br><br>

She earned her Sociology bachelor's degree in 2013 from the University of California, Riverside, where her skill and passion for the field first bloomed. She enjoyed learning about all the different cultures and what exactly makes up society as a whole. Jazmin has analyzed various different proposed solutions to having a better society and she is a strong believer in the idea that 'the children are our future.' She believes that with proper guidance, support, and good role models, our children will be the ones who will make an "unattainable ideal future" possible. <br><br>

Before becoming a high school guidance counselor, she was a volunteer at a substance abuse rehabilitation center and helped set up educational programs, fundraisers, and counsel some patients, helping them turn their life around. Her advanced problem-solving skills and knowledge about different groups of people were useful in handling the different issues that hindered our patients towards accepting help. 

She decided to return to her old community in order to help the youth map out their futures and take the steps towards achieving the goals they set. She shows students the different options they have and opens up opportunities for them that they themselves may not have realized were available to them. She has been helping students navigate the academic world for a little over 5 years now. Her job as a guidance counselor has proven to be fulfilling, seeing that her students often come back to update her about their successes and thank her for her involvement. Because of her education, she is specialized in many techniques that aid her in supporting her students. Her expertise in counseling and interview techniques, along with her first-hand experience with living in a lower socioeconomic community, all contribute to her success in positively impacting the youth. 
 Her continuous support and engagement with the students is reflected in the school's graduation and college enrollment statistics. <br><br>

Jazmin plans to continue her career and develop programs where she can reach more students and offer more help. She is constantly looking for ways to help as many people as possible and do good in the world.
